# ai_coding_agent

## About This Project

This is a toy version of Claude Code built using Google's Gemini API, created as part of a Boot.dev project. The agent demonstrates how to build a basic but functional AI coding assistant with surprisingly few components. At its core, the agent uses an iterative loop where it receives a coding task, analyzes the codebase context, generates code changes using Gemini's language model, and then executes those changes in the environment. The system employs a tool-calling pattern where the LLM can invoke functions to read files, write code, run commands, and observe the results. After each action, the agent receives feedback from the environment (like test results or error messages) which it uses to refine its approach in subsequent iterations. This create a feedback loop that allows the agent to iteratively solve problems, debug issues, and improve its solutions - mimicking how a human developer would approach coding tasks. While simpler than production coding assistants, this project illustrates the fundamental architecture: an LLM brain connected to a set of tools for code manipulation and execution, wrapped in a loop that allows for iterative refinement based on environmental feedback.
